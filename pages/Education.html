          My experience dancing with DefMo showed me the power of empathetic leadership and 
          expanded my artistic comfort zone. <br>
          <br>
          My tenure throwing major, campus-wide events validated that quality stems from attention to detail. <br>
          <br>
          Concordia showed me what I love to do, gifted me with a love for learning, and surrounded me with a wealth of inspiring peers.

            CSL was where I learned how to articulate my ideas (as head of the school newspaper),
            competed thrice in state championships (as tennis captain), <br><br>
            fell in love with learning, facilitated service events for the local community, <br> 
            designed a leadership development program for underclassmen, <br><br>
            and discovered a passion for the arts. And importantly, <br>
            it was at IMSA where I felt like I could finally be my weird self.
